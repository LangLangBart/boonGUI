      description: If applicable, copy and paste all relevant log outputs. The logs
        for 0 A.D. are overwritten on every restart, as soon as any errors/ warnings
        occur, close the game and copy the contents of `interestinglog.html` (see
        [wiki/GameDataPaths](https://trac.wildfiregames.com/wiki/GameDataPaths)) into
        here. This will help to find the cause of the problem faster and require fewer
        follow-ups.

      description: If applicable, copy and paste all relevant log outputs. The logs for 0 A.D. are overwritten on every restart, as soon as any errors/ warnings occur, close the game and copy the contents of `interestinglog.html` (see [wiki/GameDataPaths](https://trac.wildfiregames.com/wiki/GameDataPaths)) into here. This will help to find the cause of the problem faster and require fewer follow-ups.

# dependabot.yml file with updates
# You enable DependaBot version updates by checking a dependabot.yml configuration file in to your repository's .github directory.

# IMPORTANT: I hate it when workflows fail, the open-pull-requests-limit is set to 1 and is checked weekly, not monthly. When multiple PRs are made by Dependabot at the same time, it gives an error saying: Pull request Protected branch rules not configured for this branch.
# Maybe I just need to configure something in the settings, but after try to get it to work for hours I gave up.
# This is just crappy software, in dependabot version 1 they had an automerge feature and removed it in version 2.

# dependabot.yml file with updates
# You enable DependaBot version updates by checking a dependabot.yml configuration file in to your repository's .github directory.

# IMPORTANT: If more than two PR's are made by dependabot, the third one fails, I don't know why. But I hate it when any workflows fail in my github action, the limit is set to 2 for open-pull-requests-limit and is checked weekly rather than monthly.
# Maybe I just need to configure something in the settings, but I was annoyed and gave up.
